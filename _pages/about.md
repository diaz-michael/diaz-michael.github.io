Hi! I'm Michael Diaz. I'm a business analyst in Edmonton, Alberta. I graduated from the University of Alberta's Alberta School of Business with a Bachelor of Commerce, Cooperative Education degree, majoring in business technology management.

I have a passion for data visualizations, hockey, and photography! This site served as a personal portfolio during my student years.
