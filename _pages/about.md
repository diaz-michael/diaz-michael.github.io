Hi! I'm Michael Diaz. I'm a student at the University of Alberta's Alberta School of Business and am working towards my Bachelor of Commerce, Cooperative Education degree, majoring in management information systems.

I have a passion for data visualizations, hockey, and photography! This portfolio is currently under-construction as I am in the process adding project documentation.
